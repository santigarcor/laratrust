# Introduction

Laratrust is a Laravel package that lets you handle very easily roles and permissions inside your application. All of this through a very simple configuration process and API.

Here you can see some examples:

```php
$adminRole = Role::where('name', 'admin')->first();
$editUserPermission = Permission::where('name', 'edit-user')->first();
$user = User::find(1);

$user->attachRole($adminRole);
// Or
$user->attachRole('admin');

$user->attachPermission($editUserPermission);
// Or
$user->attachPermission('edit-user');
```

You can also check if a user has some permissions or roles:

```php
$user->isAbleTo('edit-user');

$user->hasRole('admin');
$user->isA('guide');
$user->isAn('admin');
```

It also supports teams, multiple users and it has a simple admin panel and it is compatible with Laravel's policies and gates system.
